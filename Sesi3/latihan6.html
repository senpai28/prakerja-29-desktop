            This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a
            proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take
            up.
            If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to
            all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much of the space
            either one of the others (or it will try, at least).

            This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length
            (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was
            temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on the
            item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its
            brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.
